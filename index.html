		<p>The cards of this variant <a href="https://aonprd.com/MagicArtifactsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Harrow%20Deck%20of%20Many%20Things" target="_blank"><em class="the-deck">harrow deck of many things</em></a> are gold-edged, and give off a soft, comforting glow in the hands of nonevil creatures; evil creatures instead find the glow sickening.</p>
		<p>The <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> was created by <a href="" target="_blank">Chaldira Zuzaristan</a> in collaboration with <a href="" target="_blank">Nivi Rhombodazzle</a>. It has only 34 cards instead of the regular 54; however, each of these cards have beneficial effects. Most of the cards can only be drawn twice; drawing a specific card after already having drawn it grants an empowered version of the ability gained from drawing the card initially. Allegedly, 34 specific creatures in all of existence can draw a card specific to them a third time, granting a unique and incredibly powerful ability; at this point in time, several of these individuals have already drawn their cards, and several more are waiting for their bearers to come along...</p>
		<p>Instead of declaring how many cards are to be drawn beforehand, any creature capable of drawing from the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> can only do so a certain number of times (not counting redraws or bonus draws from certain cards), until they have drawn every available card the maximum number of times, or until one card has been drawn thrice. The amount varies by individual, though those with a grand destiny seem capable of drawing more than most. Attempting to draw more cards than the maximum designated to a creature pulls up only blanks.</p>
		<p>The deck has a habit of teleporting about the multiverse according to its own whims, appearing in the possessions of good-aligned creatures, their non-evil companions, or those who are earnestly turning away from evil and have become neutral on their path to redemption. In particular, it seems to favour those individuals able to draw multiple times. If any individual who has already drawn from the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> can draw additional times from the deck for whatever reason, it usually appears amongst his or her possessions within 24 hours of the change.</p>
		<p>If aware of the deck&#39;s current location (usually after a bearer draws <span><a href="#the-teamster" class="the-deck">The Teamster</a></span>), Chaldira can deign to have it stay primarily in the possession of a specific individual or group, disappearing only to appear amongst the possessions of that individual&#39;s or group&#39;s allies.</p>

				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Bear</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Bear bestows upon the character the <strong>lesser creature lord</strong> template. This functions as the <a href="https://aonprd.com/MonsterTemplates.aspx?ItemName=Animal%20Lord" target="_blank">animal lord</a> template, with the following changes.
				<ul> 
					<li>The base creature may be any type of creature with an Intelligence of at least 6 and at least 8 Hit Dice. Creatures with less than 8 Hit Dice gain the template&#39;s other benefits upon gaining 8 Hit Dice, but otherwise only gain darkvision 60 feet and scent.</li>
					<li>The &#39;base animal&#39; (hereafter referred to as the secondary creature) need not be an animal, but must correspond to the base creature as follows. Humanoids must select an animal or vermin; outsiders must select an animal or magical beast; dragons must select an animal, vermin, magical beast, or good-aligned outsider; aberrations must select a magical beast or vermin.</li>
					<li>The secondary creature may be up to three size categories larger or smaller than the base creature.</li>
					<li>The lesser creature lord does not increase all of its ability scores by an additional +4. Starting at 10 HD, and for every 4 levels gained thereafter, the lesser creature lord increases one of its ability scores by 4. The bonuses are applied in a descending order starting with the secondary creature&#39;s highest ability score, and do not stack with enhancement bonuses from magical items or spells; only the highest bonus applies. Each gestalt level a creature possesses counts as 2 levels for this purpose.</li>
					<li>The lesser creature lord gains aspects of the secondary creature even in the form of the base creature. A lesser bear lord, for instance, may become notably more hairy and possess clawed hands and sharp teeth even in humanoid form. Both forms count as the natural form of the lesser creature lord, and the change shape ability functions even in an <a href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Antimagic%20Field" title="Antimagic Field (AoN)"><em>antimagic field</em></a>, null magic zone, or similar effect.</li>
					<li>Instead of dominion, the lesser creature lord gains <strong title="In any form, the lesser creature lord can communicate and empathise with creatures of a similar type to its secondary creature as if it shared a language with them. It can use Diplomacy or Handle Animal to alter such creatures&#39; attitudes, and when doing so gains a +4 racial bonus on the check. Additionally, such creatures always start out at least indifferent towards the lesser creature lord, and do not attack it unless it attacks them first.">greater lycanthropic empathy</strong>.</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Bear upgrades the character&#39;s lesser creature lord template to the <strong>greater creature lord</strong> template. The character immediately gains a +6 bonus to all ability scores (replacing the incrimental ability score bonuses of the lesser bear lord template, but otherwise interacting with other effects the same way), becomes immune to all transmutation effects (but can choose to allow transmutation effects to affect it), and gains an <strong title="Creatures similar to the greater creature lord&#39;s secondary creature gain a morale bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, ability checks and skill checks equal to 1 plus 1 for every 4 Hit Dice the greater creature lord possesses while within its aura of lordship.">aura of lordship</strong> extending out to 60 feet.</p>

				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Big Sky</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Big Sky bestows upon the character the <strong title="The character selects a specific combat maneuver and a specific weapon (such as rapier or crossbow). As a swift action, the character can gain a +10 bonus to CMB to perform that maneuver and a +10 bonus to CMD against maneuvers of that type (as well as similar maneuvers, such as awesome blows for bull rush) for 1 round. 

Using a weapon of a type different from their chosen weapon to perform the chosen maneuver while benefiting from this bonus has adverse effects. A metal weapon cracks with each attempt; 5 cracks renders it broken, at which point it must be repaired before it can be used in conjunction with this ability again. If made of wood, the weapon is instead completely destroyed after being used in this manner 5 times.">big sky maneuverer</strong> ability.</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Big Sky upgrades the character&#39;s big sky maneuverer ability to the <strong title="The character selects an additional type of combat maneuver to the first selected with Big Sky Maneuverer. The character gains a constant +10 bonus to CMB to perform (and to CMD against) this maneuver, as well as the maneuver initially selected (instead of having to activate the bonus as a swift action), and is no longer at risk of damaging any weapon used with these maneuvers. Whenever the creature successfully uses one of the selected maneuvers against an opponent, it may make a free sunder attempt against one metal item on its target&#39;s person, gaining a +10 bonus to the attempt and to the damage dealt if successful (this extra damage ignores hardness). This sunder attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character may do this only once per maneuver per round.">big sky maneuvers</strong> ability.</p>

				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Brass Dwarf</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Brass Dwarf grants the character immunity to one element (chosen by the character) to which the character does not already have resistance or immunity, and resistance 10 to another element (chosen at random) to which the character does not already have resistance or immunity.</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Brass Dwarf upgrades the resistance granted by the first draw to immunity, grants resistance 20 to another element (chosen at random) to which the character does not already have resistance or immunity, and doubles all other resistances the character naturally and permanently possesses (including resistances gained after this boon is gained).</p>

				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Carnival</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Carnival allows the character to draw up to nine other cards and select any two of the character&#39;s choice.</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Carnival allows the character to draw up to nine other cards and select any two of the character&#39;s choice. The effects of any cards taken from this second set of nine resolve as if the character drew them twice, and the character is considered to have drawn the cards twice for all purposes (as such, a creature cannot usually select a card from this set if it has already drawn such a card before).</p>
			</details>
			</li>
			<li>
			<details>
				<summary><em class="the-deck" id="the-courtesan">The Courtesan</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Courtesan awakens the character&#39;s favourite item (preferably a magic weapon). The item becomes an intelligent item with the character&#39;s alignment and a personality complementing the character&#39;s in some fashion. The item has a starting disposition of helpful towards the character, and never enters a personality conflict with the character so long as it has a disposition of at least friendly towards the character. If the character has no items, an intelligent item soon falls into the character&#39;s possession. Alternatively, if the character already has an intelligent item, the item&#39;s alignment is changed to the character&#39;s, and its disposition towards the character is improved one step; its personality does not change.</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Courtesan enhances the character&#39;s previously awakened item. It becomes irrevocably bound to the character. Additionally, a magic weapon gains the following special ability.</p>
				<p class="minipage"><em><strong>Bonded Blade (Ex, Su)</strong></em> The weapon is irrevocably bonded to the character that awakened it with the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> (hereafter referred to as its bonded creature) in a manner very similar to a bladebound magus&#39;s black blade. Its enhancement bonus increases with the amount of base attack bonus its bonded creature is currently using (+1 starting at BAB +3; +2 starting at BAB +5; +3 starting at BAB +9; +4 starting at BAB +13; and +5 at BAB +17 and beyond).
				<br><br>
				In the hands of any other creature, the weapon cannot be properly wielded or easily carried. If held by any creature that is not its bonded creature, the weapon&#39;s weight increases enough to encumber the creature as if it was carrying a heavy load, and no other creature is considered proficient when wielding it.
				<br><br>
				The weapon returns to its bonded creature&#39;s possession within 1 round of being lost or stolen as long as they are on the same plane. Furthermore, as a standard action, the bonded creature can summon the weapon to its hand (or other appendage) regardless of distance; this is a supernatural teleportation effect, and functions even across planar boundaries as long as neither party is in an area of null magic.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>The Courtesan has a unique interaction with <a href="#the-forge" class="the-deck">the Forge</a>. If a weapon enhanced by the Courtesan twice is enhanced by the Forger (the entity summoned by the Forge) at least once, the weapon gains a +1 special weapon quality and is inscribed with a <a href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rune%20of%20Durability"><em>rune of durability</em></a> that cannot be suppressed by mortal means, instead of the Forge&#39;s usual effects. If enhanced by the Forger twice, it gains an additional +2 in special weapon qualities (unless it already possesed special weapon qualities adding up to +3 or more - including from the initial Forger enhancement).</p>
				<p>In either case, the weapon is bound to the character&#39;s very soul; this process takes 8 hours (nauseating the character with pain for the first minute unless they roll a natural 20 on a Fortitude save or are immune to pain effects), after which, should the character ever become mythic, the weapon automatically becomes a legendary item scaling with the character&#39;s total number of mythic tiers or ranks, as if by the legendary gear mythic boon. Upon becoming an artifact, the weapon can be summoned to hand as a swift action (if minor) or a free action (if major) as long as it is within line of sight of its bonded creature, and it can be summoned to hand even if placed within an <a href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Antimagic%20Field"><em>antimagic field</em></a>, null magic zone, or similar effect, ignoring non-mythic barriers against teleportation. The weapon is considered to have the dedicated bond, eternal bond, and returning (any plane) legendary powers for the purposes of prerequisites.</p>

				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Cricket</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Cricket allows the character to draw up to six additional cards from the deck and gain the benefits of up to three of the drawn cards. The character can choose fewer than three cards from this set if desired. Additionally, for each card chosen from this set, the character gains a permanent increase of 10 feet to all its speeds (including speeds gained after gaining this benefit).</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Cricket allows the character to again draw up to six additional cards from the deck and gain the benefits of up to three of the drawn cards. The character gains a permanent increase of 20 feet to all its speeds for each card selected from this set (stacking with the increases gained from the first draw of the Cricket). Additionally, the effects of any cards taken from this second set of six resolve as if the character drew them twice, and the character is considered to have drawn the cards twice for all purposes (as such, a creature cannot usually select a card from this set if it has already drawn such a card before).</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Cyclone</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Cyclone summons one of several elder air elementals befriended by Chaldira, which proceeds to test the character in a battle lasting up to 1 minute. Characters with 10 or more HD instead face an air elemental champion (an elder air elemental with full hit points per HD and several more combat talents than usual). The elemental appears in 1d4 rounds (though it will wait for the character to relocate to an area suitable for combat).
				<br>
				<br>
				The elemental is invulnerable to all damage and other effects from creatures other than the character that drew the Cyclone, can pinpoint the square which the character occupies on its turn as a swift action, and focuses its attacks primarily on the character to the exclusion of all other targets (unless it cannot reach the character with 1 round of actions). However, if the character is aided in combat by allies (accepting beneficial magical effects, benefiting from aid another attempts, gaining flanking, and so on), the character ignores all of the elemental&#39;s DR and its elemental immunities, and can still benefit from effects inflicted by allies&#39; actions (such as successful feints against the elemental) so long as those allies are not also attempting to deal damage to the elemental.<br>
				<br>
				If defeated within 1 minute, in place of any experience that might be gained, the elemental grants the character the <strong title="The character gains a natural, extraordinary fly speed of 100 feet (perfect maneuverability), gains a +4 bonus to Dexterity, and ignores all effects from adverse winds. If the character already possesses an extraordinary fly speed, that speed is increased by 100 feet, and its maneuverability increases to perfect">blessing of the wind</strong>.</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Cyclone instead summons either an air elemental champion, or (for characters with 15 HD or more) an air elemental legend (an exemplar elder air elemental champion striker 4). The elemental functions much the same as one summoned by one drawing of the Cyclone (as outlined above). If this summoned elemental is defeated, it grants the character an even more powerful blessing - the <strong title="The character gains the &#91;air&#93; subtype and all elemental immunities (immunity to bleed, paralysis, poison, sleep, and stunning; not subject to critical hits, flanking, or precision damage; does not have to breathe, eat or sleep).">mantle of the wind</strong>.</p>
				<p>If a character fails to defeat an elemental summoned by one drawing of the Cyclone, the character still gains a +4 bonus to Dexterity and counts the Cyclone as half of a drawn card instead of one drawn card; drawing the card again and defeating the elemental grants the full benefits as well as counting as one drawn card. If a character fails to defeat an elemental twice, the character also gains the ability to ignore adverse winds, but the card counts as having been drawn once; drawing the card again and defeating the elemental grants the fly speed and does not count against the character&#39;s allotment, nor does it count as having drawn the card twice. If the character fails to defeat an elemental three times, it finally gains the fly speed, but is considered to have drawn the card twice from the deck (and thus cannot draw it again) and counts the card twice against its total.</p>

				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Dance</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Dance bestows upon the character the <strong title="A creature with this ability rolls twice on all initiative checks and can choose either result, and gains a racial bonus to Perform (dance) checks equal to its total Hit Dice as well as a +1 dodge bonus to AC for every 8 points of its Perform (dance) bonus; it gains Perform (dance) as a class skill if it does not already possess it, and can use either Dexterity or Charisma to determine its Perform (dance) bonus.">battle rhythm</strong> ability.</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Dance upgrades the battle rhythm ability to the <strong title="A creature with this ability rolls three times on all initiative checks and can choose its preferred result, gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and to its Reflex saves for every 8 points of his Perform (dance) bonus (replacing the bonus from battle rhythm), and gains improved evasion (as the rogue ability).">battle rhytm virtuoso</strong> ability.</p>

The creature must know exactly where it wishes to travel, such as a place it has been or a location on a map, but not a vague or hidden location, like the richest dungeon in the world or the Lost City of Ird.

				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Empty Throne</em></summary>
				<p>The Empty Throne of the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> functions much the same as it does in a normal <a href="https://aonprd.com/MagicArtifactsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Harrow%20Deck%20of%20Many%20Things" target="_blank"><em>harrow deck of many things</em></a> - the character that draws it gains 15,000 gp at some point after drawing it, as well as a title of import. The Empty Throne of the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> almost never simply grants a noble title, however; characters that draw this card usually become individuals whose accomplishments are recorded in history, and whose exploits become stuff of legend. This, of course, takes time and effort on the character&#39;s part, but the card grants opportunities and expedites the spread of the character&#39;s accomplishments with almost supernatural quickness.</p>
				<p>The Empty Throne is one of the few cards that can only be drawn once; the effects are potent enough that they cannot meaningfully be improved upon.</p>

			<details>
				<summary><em class="the-deck">The Foreign Trader</em></summary>
				<p>The Foreign Trader of the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> functions much the same as it does in a normal <a href="https://aonprd.com/MagicArtifactsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Harrow%20Deck%20of%20Many%20Things" target="_blank"><em>harrow deck of many things</em></a> - it summons the eponymous Foreign Trader to offer credit for magical items in exchange for years of the character&#39;s life. The Foreign Trader lost a bet with Chaldira, though, so when summoned by the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em>, the Trader grants several options - the entity accepts both years lived and years yet to be lived, and thus characters can choose to become older or younger (but once chosen, the choice cannot be changed). Aging in this manner for credit with which to gain magical items grants both the penalties and bonuses of aging.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, the Trader can offer a character the benefits of aging without any of the drawbacks. A character that chooses this option ages up one category, but ignores the penalties for aging into that category, and is treated as one age category younger when determining age penalties from natural aging and other effects. This functions even for creatures with nonstandard aging, such as dragons.</p>
				<p>The Foreign Trader is one of the few cards that can only be drawn once; the Trader does not take repeat customers from the deck. Additional draws of this card instead replace it with another, as if the character was immortal; repeat draws of the Foreign Trader do not count against the character&#39;s total. Similarly, if a character refuses to deal with the Foreign Trader, the character gains a redraw as if immortal.</p>

				<summary><em class="the-deck" id="the-forge">The Forge</em></summary>
				<p>When drawn once, the Forge summons a uniquely gifted azer blacksmith known only as the <em>Forger</em>, seated at a portable anvil and holding a hammer and tongs. An acquaintance of Chaldira&#39;s, the gruff and blunt Forger offers his forging and reforging services freely to characters that draw this card. This allows characters to select any one weapon or suit of armour in their possession and either upgrade it or change its magical properties, so long as the final result is worth 20,000 gp or less. The change takes the Forger a standard action of hammering at the gear on his anvil. This functions even for mundane weapons and armour, though the gear must be at least masterwork quality (the Forger is willing to upgrade items to masterwork status as a separate standard action, but for some reason insists on charging for this service in particular). The Forger can also change the composition of the selected weapon or armour, so long as the character has another weapon or armour of the material desired; this secondary piece of gear is sacrificed to change the composition of the actual gear selected, and the special material cost does not count towards the price limit of magical qualities added.</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Forge summons the Forger again, who can either enhance another piece of gear as detailed above, or can further enhance the first piece of gear he upgraded for the character. This grants a unique quality to the item in question, suited to how the character generally tends to use it. In either case, a repeat customer receives a small bonus - the Forger inscribes a <a href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rune%20of%20Durability" target="_blank"><em>rune of durability</em></a> upon the selected gear, which cannot be removed or suppressed by mortal means.</p>
				<p>Any gear enhanced by the Forger at least once becomes bound to the character for which it was enhanced - other creatures have difficulty keeping the gear away from the character, as well as difficulty using it. A weapon cannot be used proficiently by any creature other than the character for which it was enhanced, and armour cannot be donned at all by creatures other than the character for which it was enhanced. Additionally, so long as such a weapon or suit of armour is within at least 100 feet, it returns to the character&#39;s possession within 1 round if disarmed or stolen. Characters further than this can spend 1 minute of concentration to summon the weapon or armour into their possession; this is a teleportation effect that functions even across planes, but the character in question cannot move or be moved during the minute of concentration, or it automatically fails.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>The Forge has a unique interaction with <a href="#the-courtesan" class="the-deck">the Courtesan</a>. If a weapon enhanced by the Courtesan twice is enhanced by the Forger at least once, the weapon gains a +1 special weapon quality and is inscribed with a <a href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rune%20of%20Durability" target="_blank"><em>rune of durability</em></a> that cannot be suppressed by mortal means, instead of the Forge&#39;s usual effects. If enhanced by the Forger twice, it gains an additional +2 in special weapon qualities (unless it already possesed special weapon qualities adding up to +3 or more - including from the initial Forger enhancement).</p>
				<p>In either case, the weapon is bound to the character&#39;s very soul; this process takes 8 hours (nauseating the character with pain for the first minute unless they roll a natural 20 on a Fortitude save or are immune to pain effects), after which, should the character ever become mythic, the weapon automatically becomes a legendary item scaling with the character&#39;s total number of mythic tiers or ranks, as if by the legendary gear mythic boon. Upon becoming an artifact, the weapon can be summoned to hand as a swift action (if minor) or a free action (if major) as long as it is within line of sight of its bonded creature, and it can be summoned to hand even if placed within an <a href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Antimagic%20Field" target="_blank"><em>antimagic field</em></a>, null magic zone, or similar effect, ignoring non-mythic barriers against teleportation.

The character can summon a paladin of Chaldira of a level equal to the character&#39;s total Hit Dice - 3, once per week for 5 minutes, by thrusting the weapon into the ground as a standard action; the paladin always possessses a <em>holy avenger</em>, and aids the character in any way permitted by the paladin&#39;s alignment and Chaldira&#39;s code for the duration before disappearing. This ability always summons the same paladin, and if slain, the paladin simply disappears, receiving healing from Chaldira before returning to wherever they may have come from.</p>

				<p>When drawn once, the Wanderer can either turn one of the character&#39;s mundane items into a magical item worth 20,000 gp or less, or upgrade a magical item that can be upgraded (such as most magical weapons and armour), so long as the total cost of the item is 20,000 gp or less after the upgrades. When upgrading an item that the character paid to have upgraded normally, the character receives a &#39;refund&#39; in the form of a bag of gems equal in value to the amount spent upgrading the item.</p>
				<p>When drawn twice, the Wanderer can have the above effects on a separate item, or can enhance the previously altered item. A character possessing an item altered twice by the Wanderer may add another 30,000 gp&#39;s worth of enhancements to the item during the character&#39;s daily preparations; these enhancements last 24 hours. If the item is a weapon, these enhancements can be special weapon qualities; if the item is a suit of armour, the enhancements can be special armour qualities; if the item is a slotted magical item, the enhancements can be the effects of any other items occuping the same slot that add up to 30,000 gp or less; if the item is slotless, the enhancements can be the effects of any other items with the same general shape that add up to 30,000 gp or less.</p>

				<p>The Winged Serpent of the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> functions much the same as it does in a normal <a href="https://aonprd.com/MagicArtifactsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Harrow%20Deck%20of%20Many%20Things" target="_blank"><em>harrow deck of many things</em></a> - it grants a character a single wish each time it is drawn, which can be used whenever the character wishes as a free action that can be taken even outside the character&#39;s turn. This &#39;wish,&#39; despite being activated by a phrase beginning with &#39;I wish&#39;, is actually an effect equivalent to an extremely powerful <a href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Miracle" target="_blank"><em>miracle</em></a> (CL 30th) fulfilled by Chaldira. As such, she holds the right to veto any wish that goes against her ethos and beliefs, or indeed any wish that she feels would be a waste of her powers.</p>
				<p>As a benevolent demigoddess, Chaldira always interprets a wish made by a character that has drawn the Winged Serpent in the best possible way, and will generally clarify with the character what exactly they hope to accomplish with the wish before finalising it (this halts time for everyone but the character if the wish is used in combat or another dangerous situation, though any negative effects from which the character is currently suffering are similarly paused). If a character uses a wish in a particularly selfless or entirely unselfish way, Chaldira generally rewards them in a subtle but extremely powerful way in addition to fulfilling the wish - this usually takes the form of a <strong>wishgranter</strong> bonus, an inherent bonus to an ability score of the character&#39;s choice equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 HD the character possesses (maximum +6). If the character would receive a greater inherent bonus from another source, the character may freely choose to swap the wishgranter bonus to another score without an inherent bonus. At Chaldira&#39;s discretion, or based on the character&#39;s abilities and the specifics of the wish, this may instead have alternate effects or unlock new abilities in the character.</p>
				<p>A character can only draw the Winged Serpent twice from the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em>.</p>

		<p>The deck is strongly good-aligned and mildly chaos-aligned. Only nonevil creatures can draw from the <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em>; evil creatures suffer a negative level and are sickened as long as they hold the item, and take 1d4 points of sacred damage each time they attempt to draw a card from it, plus 1d4 for every prior attempt at drawing from the deck they have ever made. The sickened condition, the damage, and the temporary negative level persist as long as the evil creature bears the deck, and cannot be removed by any means as long as the deck is held; if released, any damage suffered can only be recovered by non-evil means of healing (natural regeneration and fast healing does not bypass this restriction).</p>

		<p><u>DESTRUCTION:</u> The <em class="the-deck">deck of blessings</em> can be destroyed in a similar manner to a regular <em>harrow deck of many things</em>, with the caveat that the same evil creature must have attempted to draw from the deck 500 times and survived beforehand. Until this condition is met, the cards are impervious to damage from any source.</p>
